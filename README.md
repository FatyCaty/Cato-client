## Information
> Should be safe from log4j if u set up mcp918 with safe log4j version (replace old log4j api and core jars) with new ones from https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html (direct download to the one I am using: https://dlcdn.apache.org/logging/log4j/2.17.2/apache-log4j-2.17.2-bin.zip)

## Setting up Mcp918
1. Extract the mcp918 .zip archive into a folder with the name of your client or just something.
2. Run the decompile.bat or decompile.sh file - If you get any errors run 1.8.8 and 1.8 Vanilla Minecraft and try running the decompile.bat or decompile.sh again. - or put a 1.8 or 1.8.8 vanilla version in your versions folder (.minecraft/versions)
3. After that open eclipse and set the worksspace to the folder 'eclipse' in the mcp918 folder.
4. Done!

> The Optifine version I tried does not work with this from what I know with this mcp version.
